* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.4

- do not lose the setuid bit after a write when the writeback cache is used.
- skip creating a whiteout if the node is present only on the upper layer.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.3

- correctly delete an existing whiteout when the file is recreated (regression introduced with 0.5).
- fix ioctl on directories.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.2

- avoid ino lookup if not necessary.
- include st_dev in the hash key.  Now the same inode number can be safely used by lower
  directories on different file systems.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.1

- fix a regression introduced with 0.6 where UNIX sockets could not be correctly created.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6

- fix an issue where changes to an inode would not be visible from another hard link.
  The issue was always present but was made easier to reproduce with fuse-overlayfs 0.5
  that enables FUSE writeback by default.
